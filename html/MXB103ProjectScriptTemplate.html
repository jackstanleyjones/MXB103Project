%% 1  Introduction test
% As part of Brisbane's "New World City" transformation, the Brisbane City

%% 5 Analysis
%
% In this section, the model predictions are analysed with respect to the
% key questions being asked about the proposal.

%% 5.1 Timing and bounces
%
% Describe the question, and then answer it.  In this case, you will refer
% to Figure 1 of $y$ versus $t$.
% 
% The model produced above as a result of using a higher order modelling method (Second Order Taylor Method) agrees with the company's claim of 10 "bounces" in 60 seconds (as seen in Figure 1). While both models agree on the general behaviour regarding bounce frequency, the Second Order Taylor Series Model produces slightly more decay in bounce amplitude over time than the Euler Model. This is because, by using a higher order method, the error term in the Taylor model decays by an order of magnitude (tenfold) faster (i.e. it consequently accumulates less error given the same number of iterations). Specifically, the Second Order Taylor Method works by taking the position of the jumper ($y$) and adds the velocity of the jumper for a given time step interval ($h$), same as the Euler Method. However, the Taylor Method also includes the additional acceleration term (velocity derivative) that is scaled by$h^2/2$. In this case the extra derivative term represents the reduction in downward acceleration when the bungee rope is in tension (when $y$ > $L$).  The explicit consideration of the bungee rope’s opposition to downward motion logically results in the model coming to a rest/ equilibrium state faster (less “bouncing” as a result of faster periodic amplitude decay) than when it is not included. 
%% 5.2 Maximum speed experienced by the jumper
%
% Describe the question, and then answer it.  In this case, you will create
% a figure of $v$ versus $t$ and refer to it to answer the question.
% 
% As can be seen in Figure 2, the maximum speed of the jumper is achieved
% at the moment before the first upward bounce (i.e. the last moment of
% freefall from the inital jump from the platform) when the jumper is
% travelling at approximately 20.0325m/s. This is logical as the resistive
% force of the bungee rope has not yet begun to contribute to decay in the
% bounce amplitude and as such the inertia of the jumper is at its maximum as they have been in uninterrrupted freefall due to gravity.

plot(t, vm);

title('Figure 2: Bungee Jump Velocity Over Time (Second Order Taylor Series Modelling)');
maximum_speed = max(abs(vm))

%% 5.3 Maximum acceleration experienced by the jumper
%
% Describe the question, and then answer it.  In this case, you will call
% a function to numerically differentiate $v$ to find $a$.  Then plot $a$ 
% versus $t$ and refer to it to answer the question.

%% 5.4 Distance travelled by the jumper
%
% Describe the question, and then answer it.  In this case, you will call
% a function to numerically integrate $|v|$ to find the distance.

%% 5.5 Automated camera system
%
% Describe the question, and then answer it.  In this case, you will
% fit an interpolating polynomial through the four points in your solution
% $y$ that lie either side of the camera location.  Then use that
% polynomial to solve for when the jumper passes the camera.

%% 5.6 Water touch option
%
% Describe the question, and then answer it.  In this case, you will
% re-solve the equations with different parameters for $L$ and $k$.  
% Experiment to find which values work best for the water touch option, but 
% include only the best combination that you found in the submitted code.

%% 6 Conclusion
%
% Conclude your report by summing up your findings and making any
% recommendations.
